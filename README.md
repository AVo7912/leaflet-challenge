# Leaflet Challenge

The goal of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using Leaflet library to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
My job was to create a map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
Popups are included and provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
A legend is provided showing context for the map data.
